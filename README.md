Project Title: 🤖 Gesture-Controlled Servo with Hand Recognition 🖐️

Description:

Dive into the captivating world of interactive technology with the Gesture-Controlled Servo project! 🚀 This Raspberry Pi-powered endeavor blends computer vision, machine learning, and hardware interfacing to create a dynamic system where a servo motor responds to recognized hand gestures captured by a webcam.

Harnessing the might of the Mediapipe library, the project achieves remarkable precision in hand tracking and landmark detection. The Raspberry Pi, armed with OpenCV and TensorFlow, captures real-time video, processes frames, and utilizes a pre-trained model to predict hand gestures.

👉 Once a distinct hand gesture is identified, the servo motor gracefully comes to life, executing actions based on the recognized gestures. This seamless integration provides an intuitive, hands-free control mechanism for automating tasks or devices according to user-defined movements.
