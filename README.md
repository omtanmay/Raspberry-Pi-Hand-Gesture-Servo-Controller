Project Title: Gesture-Controlled Servo with Hand Recognition

Description:

The Gesture-Controlled Servo with Hand Recognition is an interactive project that combines computer vision, machine learning, and hardware interfacing using a Raspberry Pi. The goal of this project is to create a system where a servo motor is controlled based on hand gestures recognized by a webcam.

The project leverages the power of the Mediapipe library for hand tracking and landmark detection, enabling precise recognition of hand gestures. The Raspberry Pi captures real-time video from a connected webcam, processes the frames using OpenCV and TensorFlow, and predicts hand gestures using a pre-trained model.

Once a specific hand gesture is recognized, the corresponding action triggers the movement of a servo motor. This creates a hands-free and intuitive control mechanism for automating tasks or devices based on user-defined gestures.

Key Features:

Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using Mediapipe.
Hand gesture recognition with a pre-trained machine learning model.
Servo motor control based on recognized gestures.
Expandable and customizable for various gestures and applications.
Educational exploration of computer vision, machine learning, and hardware interfacing on a Raspberry Pi.
